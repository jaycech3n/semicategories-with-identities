# Semicategories with Identities

This is an Agda formalization accompanying the TYPES 2023 abstract of the same title.

It depends on the [Agda 2.6.1-compatible fork](https://github.com/awswan/HoTT-Agda/tree/agda-2.6.1-compatible) of the HoTT-Agda library, and typechecks in Agda version 2.6.2.2.

The canonical starting point is `Index.lagda.md`; see there for more.
